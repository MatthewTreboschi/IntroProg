# IntroProg

This is a repository for an introductoy programming course for highschoolers ran over the summer of 2021 by Matthew Trebocshi. The course was 4 hours a day, 3 days a week, for 5 weeks, and covered basic coding in python and java, and even attempted to cover some git, hence the repository.

The most notable feature in here is the students' project: a mini password generator. It asks you what you want the specifications of your password to be (length and whether or not to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and/or special characters) and then randomly generates a password based on those specifications
